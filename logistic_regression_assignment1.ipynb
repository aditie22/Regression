    "ROC Curve: The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different threshold values. Each point on the curve corresponds to a different threshold setting for the classifier.

To make a binary decision, a threshold is chosen, and instances with predicted probabilities above the threshold are classified as positive, while those below are classified as negative.

    "Information Gain/Mutual Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information gain or mutual information measures the dependency between the target variable and each feature. Higher values indicate more informative features.\n",
    "Variance Threshold:\n",

    "Correlation Matrix:\n",

    "Highly correlated features may provide redundant information. Analyzing the correlation matrix and removing one of the correlated features can improve model simplicity without losing much information.\n",
    "Forward Selection and Backward Elimination:\n",

    "Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and adds the most significant one at each step. Backward elimination begins with all features and removes the least significant one at each step. Both methods iteratively refine the feature set.\n",

    "Cost-sensitive Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce a misclassification cost matrix to penalize misclassifying the minority class more heavily. This can be done by incorporating class-specific costs into the loss function during model training.\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ensemble methods like bagging or boosting with algorithms that inherently handle imbalanced datasets well. Algorithms like AdaBoost and Random Forests can be effective in these scenarios.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection:\n",

    "Treat the minority class as an anomaly and use anomaly detection techniques to identify instances of the minority class. This is applicable when the minority class represents abnormal or rare occurrences.\n",
    "Adjust Decision Threshold:\n",
